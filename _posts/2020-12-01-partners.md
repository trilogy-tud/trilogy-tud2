# Roboat

The Roboat is a barge-like, multi-purpose USV that is being developed to collect waste and transport construction materials in the centre of Amsterdam [[ref](https://www.ust-media.com/ust-magazine/UST031/76/)].
The novel robotic boat is easy to manufacture, highly maneuverable, and capable of accurate trajectory tracking in both indoor and outdoor environments [[ref](https://www.ams-institute.org/urban-challenges/smart-urban-mobility/roboat/)].
Current tests consists of way-point finding, autonomously docking and undocking, and obstacle avoidance. Features:

* The full-scale boat measures 2 by 4 meters. “These relatively small dimensions make the boat well suited for the urban environment,” says Carlo Ratti, Director of MIT Senseable City Lab and Principal Investigator in the project.

* The 12 kW battery currently provides 9-hours of non-stop operating time which enables the possibilities for various use cases.

# Zoev City

[Zoev City](https://www.zoevcity.nl/amsterdam-vaart/) stands for *Zorgeloze Oplossing Elektrisch Vervoer*, or, a seamless electric city transport solution. 

* Developed the first officially certified electric tug/push boat. It transports building materials to various building projects in the city centre.

* Plan: fifteen hubs in the city where transport ships can load and unload - from where cargo continues by electric trolleys.

* Assets: electric tug/pusher and over thirty floating city hubs, some of which are covered in the dimensions 14 x 3.5 m and 20 x 4.25 m. In the coming period we will be investing heavily in the transport of goods, building materials and waste by water.


* GOAL: Develop a logistics system that can accommodate multiple shipping companies, such that the city can be supplied with building materials and/or other types of goods. For example, supplies to private individuals, shops, and other companies can travel by water and waste will be taken back with them.

* CONCEPT: Trucks unload goods at a warehouse outside the city and all goods are distributed to the final destinations via other city hubs. Loading and unloading locations are small city hubs spread throughout the city The intention is to increase the number of city hubs to promote urban distribution by water. Due to the use of small electric vehicles, Zoev City has in many cases the opportunity to also supply outside window times.

* Association of inner-city water transporters has been set up: VATGA - Association of Amsterdam Water Transporters of Goods and Waste.


## Construction logistics<a name="construction"><a/>

More than thirty percent of all traffic in Amsterdam is construction-related.
According to "Amsterdam Vaart", a coalition of the municipality of Amsterdam, Port of Amsterdam, TNO and Waternet, to which ORAM is affiliated, there is a lot of potential to have a large part of construction logistics run over water and thus keep the city more accessible.
Only the last mile remains via the road, from the mooring place to the construction site when the capacity on the road permits [ref](https://www.zoevcity.nl/de-kracht-van-de-gracht-stadsdistributie-en-bouwlogistiek-over-het-water/).

Amsterdam Vaart! has already achieved a reduction of 10,000 inner-city road kilometers and a considerable CO<sup>2</sup> reduction [[ref]](https://www.ams-institute.org/events/ama-smart-mobility-festival/).

# Flying Fish

[Flying Fish](https://www.flying-fish.tech/) delivers the Watertaxi Operations System (WOS) and efficient zero-emission boats as a complete water mobility solution.
Products include the following:
* *Watertaxi operations system (WOS):* Support for booking trips, planning, monitoring, and on-vessel infrastructure.
* *Maritme Operations system (MOSbx):* the hardware working behind the scenes of the WOS (track GPS, monitor performance, log details).
* *Mobility heat maps:* uses a data-driven approach to gain insight (scientific basis for decisions on public transport initiatives) into the hard facts of mobility and accessibility in urban areas.
* *Hydrofoil consultancy:* Can reduce boats' energy consumption by 60%.

### Previous research

1. [Urban Water Mobility:
Reducing travel time within urban areas with watertaxi networks. *T.J. van Berkel*](https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:8d15f145-3c7e-45c7-86df-0f2dd102e5b9/datastream/OBJ/download).

    **RQ:** What is a generic method to find the relationship between the number ofplaced jetties for watertaxis and the passenger travel time within an urban area?

    * Data (Rotterdam)
        * Coordinates of 79 Jetty nodes (Flying Fish);
        * Coordinates of 75 city nodes 
        * Sailing times (jetty x jetty) based on the max. speed of three travel zones (Flying Fish);
        * Walking time (city node x jetty node) from Google API.
        * Public transport (city node x city node) from Google API.
