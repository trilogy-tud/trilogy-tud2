TRiLOGy use cases are developed in the network of the two most important Dutch cities, namely, Amsterdam and Rotterdam.

# Rotterdam

* Collaboration between Watertaxi Rotterdam and Flying Fish fits seamlessly into the ambition of the [Rotterdam Maritime Capital of Europe (RMCoE)](https://www.rotterdammaritimecapital.com/) network; Deploying digitisation with the aim of an efficient, sustainable and safe maritime sector[[ref](https://www.nieuwsbladtransport.nl/brandstories/2020/06/03/razendsnelle-digitale-ontwikkelingen-watertaxis/)].

* [Watertaxi Rotterdam](https://www.watertaxirotterdam.nl/) relies on a demand-dependent transport network of more than fifty private mooring places which are serviced by twenty boats.

# Amsterdam canals

* Maximum legal speed on the cityâ€™s canals, which tends to be about 6 kph [[ref](https://www.ust-media.com/ust-magazine/UST031/76/)].

* One typical summer day (August 12, 2017), 502 vessels (boats, ferries, cargo ships) cruised along the 100 km canals and their 1,200 bridges (see [visualization](http://senseable.mit.edu/roboat_summer_day/)).
 
* 17 million tourists visit Amsterdam every year (300,000 come on cruise ships).

* Canals encompass more than 100 km of waterways and over 1,500 bridges.
More than 1,500 historic buildings are located alongside such iconic canals like the Prinsengracht, Keizersgracht, Herengracht and Jordaan, effectively anchoring the cultural gravitas of the city and rightfully earning them a place for the canals in UNESCO World
Heritage Site list (source: [senseable city guide](http://senseable.mit.edu/papers/pdf/20170525_SCL_Guide_Amsterdam-Roboat.pdf)).

* Constructed in the 17<sup>th</sup> century to transport carts, people, and horses. Now, thousands of trucks drive through Amsterdam every day for the supply of shops and restaurants, the collection of waste and the supply of building materials [ref](https://www.zoevcity.nl/amsterdam-vaart/).

* The total of some 200 kilometres of quays and all those bridges are subsiding and weakening rapidly [ref](https://www.zoevcity.nl/amsterdam-vaart/).
