In TRiLOGy, we will have two main use case types: logistics and mobility.  
We need to specify these cases along the following dimensions:  
* Status quo
* Objective
* Users of the service  
* Network (part of Amsterdam to focus on)  
* The infrastructure and the interaction with the autonomous/electric vessels    
* Type of decisions involved and the associated time horizon 
* Data needed and whether it is available 
* Dynamic and/or stochastic elements to be included  

Possible application areas are assessed for their innovative character and added value for the city and its inhabitants. 

# Summary (Why? What?)<a name="summary"></a>

Both logistics and mobility-on-demand use cases consider a dynamic setting where statuses are updated frequently.
In the following, we separate use cases according to each scope.
To have a more detailed description, click in the use case.
## Logistics 

| Use case | Actors | Why? | What |
|:-:|:-:|-|-|
| [Waste collection](#waste_fixed) | AVs, residents, businesses | 1.1) Heavy trucks damage quay walls & 1.2) increase traffic, 2) curbside garbage is visual pollution, 3) poor waste separation. | Trash throwers (TTs) (e.g., businesses, residents) deposit waste at waterfront *waste containers* (WCs). AVs pick up filled WCs and deliver empty WCs.. Containers are *emptied at static location(s)*. |
| [Waste collection with waste barges](#waste_floating) | AVs, WBs, TTs, WCs, WMFs| 1.1) Heavy trucks damage quay walls & 1.1) increase traffic, 2) curbside garbage is visual pollution, 3) poor waste separation, 4) AV capacity is small.| Trash throwers (TTs) (e.g., businesses, residents) deposit waste at waterfront *waste containers* (WCs). AVs pick up filled WCs and deliver empty WCs. Containers are emptied at *waste barges* (WB). WBs are emptied at a set of static *waste managemnt facilities* (WMF). |
| [Goods' delivery with floating warehouses](#logistics) | AVs, FWs, SWs, CHs, suppliers, businesses, goods | 1.1) Heavy trucks damage quay walls & 1.2) increase traffic, 2) logistical operations increase on-street traffic (curbside usage). | Suppliers deliver goods at *static warehouses* (SWs) outside the city center.  *Floating warehouses* (FW) are loaded at SWs. AVs tug FWs to the city center. Goods in the FWs are moved to *city hubs* (CHs). From CHs, the *cargo* goes on over surface streets to fulfill *businesses* (e.g., HORECAs, supermarkets, etc.).|
| [Construction material transportation with floating warehouses](#logistics) | AVs, FWs, SWs, CHs, suppliers, construction sites, construction material| 1.1) Heavy trucks damage quay walls & 1.2) increase traffic, 2) logistical operations increase on-street traffic (curbside usage), 3) infrastructure projects lead to poorer accessibility. | *Suppliers* deliver *construction material* at *static warehouses* (SWs) outside the city center. *Floating warehouses* (FWs) are loaded at SWs. *Construction material* in the FWs is moved to construction sites or *city hubs* (CHs). From CHs, the *construction material* goes on over surface streets to fulfill *construction sites*.|

## Mobility-on-demand (MoD)

| Use case | Actors | Why? | What |
|:-:|:-:|-|-|
| [MoD](#passenger)  | AVs, passengers | 1) On-street transportation may take longer for certain ODs. | Passengers request trips. AVs pickup and deliver passengers on demand. Embarking can occur at the closest canal using [flexible edge interfaces](#interface). |
| [MoD with transfers](#transfer) | AVs, passengers, TPs | 1) On-street transportation may take longer for certain ODs, 2) fixed jetties offer low flexibility for servicing users. | Passengers request trips. AVs pickup passengers on-demand. System identifies candidate routes and AVs transfer passengers dynamically, (i) over water, (ii) at fixed transfer points, and (iii) at [temporary platforms (TP)](#tempinfra). AVs deliver passengers.
| [Routing touristic tours](#tourist) |  AVs, tourists, TAs | 1) Boat tours follow a predetermined route. | Tourists request trips to a *touristic attraction* (TA), or a set of TAs (e.g., typical boat trip) within a city. Tourists can hop-on anywhere (nearby waterways) and hop-off at TAs. |
| [Mooring private boats](#mooring) | AVs, BOs, private boats| 1) *Boat owners* (BOs) must travel to retrieve their boats (sometimes moored outside city). | A *Boat owner* (BO) moors his boats at location A (e.g., outside city). At location B, BO requests AV to retrieve his boat. AV travels to location A and tugs private boat to location B. |
| [Top-deck swapping](#modular) | all | 1) For single-purpose AV fleets, low demand results in low fleetproductivity. | Modular AVs travel to *outfitting points* (OPs) where their top-decks are replaced to handle heterogeneous demands (e.g., passengers, waste, logistics, etc.). |

# Use case description

In the following, a detailed description of each use case.

## Logistics

### Waste collection<a name="waste_fixed"></a>


For logistics, it was evident that waste collection is a prominent area to investigate.
Nevertheless, there are still things to be decided on, even if it is waste collection.

* *Status quo:* How to measure current solution drawbacks' impact (e.g., the influence of garbage trucks on traffic/quay walls, visual pollution)?

* *Objective:* min. cost (operation, deployment), min. travelled distance, min. congestion on the roads in the city, min. container overflow, min. number of. pickups, max. occupancy (kg per km).

* *Users of the service:* residential and/or commercial? If commercial, which business?

* *Network:* Besides proximity to waterways, what other factors are relevant to select the operational area (e.g., the height of the quay wall)?

* *Infrastructure:* What do the sensors provide exactly? Information on fill levels, weight, etc.?

* *Type of decisions:* Location of containers, routing/rebalancing of vessels, charging of vessels, location/number of depots, move depots, waste-stream (place&pickup, place&leave, pickup&leave, tether?)

* *Data:* Waste generation rate in different areas of the network (level can be decided), possible areas for container locations, size of possible containers, size of possible vessels to be used, vessel features (train/tethering?).

* *Dynamic and stochastic elements:*
    * Dynamic elements:
        * Routing (since containers are dynamically emptied);
        * Container location (Gemeente mentioned that they are looking into dynamic containers in the city).
    * Stochastic elements:
        * Waste generation rates;
        * Travel times;
        * Container service time.

**Questions**
* What data should smart containers provide (e.g., fill levels, weight)?
* How to account for waste separation (different containers, specific fill levels)?
* Can a single AV service several containers at once (train)?
* How long can a garbage collection area stay without a container?
* Besides proximity to waterways, what other factors are relevant to select the operational area (e.g., quay wall height)?
* What happens when a container overflows (e.g., penalty for manual handling)?
* Which factors influence regional city waste production (e.g., proximity to bars, restaurants, population density)? Can these factors be weighted to estimate spatiotemporal waste generation rates?

### Waste collection + waste barges <a name="waste_floating"></a>

AVs move filled containers to *waste barges* (WBs), where the waste is unloaded (two-layer routing).
In this setting, AVs do not need to travel to *waste management facilities* (WMF) to unload containers, taking waste immediately to the closest WB.
WBs can either (i) clean the containers on-spot or (ii) exchange filled containers with empty ones.

**Questions**

* What is the WB's capacity (e.g., kilos of waste, number of bins)?
* Can WBs access any canal (site-dependent operation)? 
* How long does it take to: (i) clean and return a container or (ii) exchange filled bins?
* What is the location of the WMFs?
* Is it necessary to take waste to different types of WMFs (e.g., incineration plants, landfills, transfer stations [[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management)])?
* How many WBs and AVs?
* What is the best route for AVs and WBs?
* What is the improvement over the setup where WBs are not considered?

[<< Back to summary](#summary)

### Goods' delivery & construction material transportation with floating warehouses<a name="logistics"></a>

*Floating warehouses* (FWs) are loaded outside the city and tugged by AVs to the city center. Then:
1. Crane vessels unload the cargo at city hubs, or
1. FWs (with cranes) unload at smaller autonomous vessels that can reach the city hubs.

Next, from city hubs, the cargo goes on to the destination (business, construction sites).

**Questions**
* What businesses can be considered (e.g., HORECA, supermarkets)?
* What is the demand distribution?
* How many city hubs?
* Can city hubs be equipped with cranes?
* What is the location of the outside-city warehouse(s)?
* How many FWs?
* How many crane vessels?
* What is the size of an FW?
* What is the optimal FW product assortment?
* How long does it take to load/unload cargo?

### Parcel delivery with floating warehoses and drones<a name="drones"></a>

Similarly to [truck+drone delivery](https://discovery.rsm.nl/articles/344-the-benefits-of-combining-drones-and-trucks-for-deliveries/), AVs can tug *floating warehouses* (FW) from where drones pick up parcels.
This setup is the waterway-equivalent to Amazon's drone deployment blimp concept (see below).

[![Amazon Blimp](http://img.youtube.com/vi/BXY3LPx8DGc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXY3LPx8DGc "Amazon drone-deploying blimp")

**Questions**
* What is the location of the city hub(s) where FWs are loaded?
* What is the capacity of an FW?
* What is the capacity and autonomy of the drones?
* How frequently AVs tug FWs to city hubs?
* What is the best assortment of parcels on an FW?
* How to manage the battery usage of AVs and drones (charging stations, charging barges)?
* How to route AVs and drones?

## Mobility-on-demand

### MoD<a name="passenger"></a>

AVs can be autonomous water taxis or buses, adding to the experience of both tourists and locals. (see e.g., Roboats)

* *Status quo:* What are the main drawbacks of the current system (e.g., long travel times)?

* *Objective:* min. pickup and in-vehicle delays, min. cost (operation, deployment), min. distance traveled.

* *Users of the service:* Passengers.

* *Network:* We consider Amsterdam's central part is interesting but needs to be further specified which area/subnetwork to focus on.

* *The infrastructure:* Can the passengers be dropped off and picked up anywhere in the network? What is the subset of possible pickup points? How much does it cost to install a new pickup point? What is the contribution of each new pickup point to the system (install
highest ROI points first)? What are the parameters to choose a node (e.g., increase connectivity, decrease traffic)?

* *Type of decisions:* Location of dropoff/pickup points, routing/rebalancing of vessels, charging of vessels (?)

* *Data:* Demand between different origin destinations at different times of the day (e.g., historical itineraries from OV-chipkaart), possible areas for pickup/dropoff points, vessel features (size, avg. speed), dynamic travel times, boarding delay.

* *Dynamic and stochastic elements:*
    * Dynamic elements:
        * Routes (updated based on the demand and the re-optimization frequency);
        * Pickup and dropoff locations (need to be clarified in terms of how restricted we are and whether they can be dynamic).
    * Stochastic elements:
        * Demand (where and when it occurs and where is the destination);
        * Travel times within the network.

**Questions**

* In which areas can AVs compete/complement other modes (see [time comparison](http://senseable.mit.edu/timing-amsterdam/) with bicycling, driving, transit, walking)?
* Is it feasible to include AVs in a *mobility-as-a-service* (MaaS) framework?

### MoD with transfers<a name="transfer"></a>

AVs can transfer passengers to one another to improve operational efficiency.
Transfer operations may be carried out:
1. *Over water:* AVs latch to each other and passengers move.    
1. *At fixed transfer points:* *AV A* delivers passengers at a fixed transfer point (jetty, quay) where they will be picked up by *AV B*.
1. *At temporary platforms:* Floating platforms are assembled on-demand to facilitate transfers between AVs.
When individual AV units are latched, different combinations of floating platforms can be created.
In their new configuration, they form floating pixels and respond as new autonomous organisms.

**Questions**

1. *Transfer over water*   
    * How long does it take to latch AVs and transfer passengers?
    * Where (i.e., which part of the route) do AVs realize transfers?
1. *Transfer at fixed points*
    * Where are the transfer points?
    * How many transfer points are necessary?
1. *Transfer at temporary platforms*
    * How many platforms?
    * Where are they located?

* To what extent AVs can alleviate on-street traffic?
* Where are the pickup points (jetties, closest quay)?
* Which destinations to include in the route?
* How to create personalized tours?
* How long boats wait at a point before departing (stochastic information)?

### Mooring private boats<a name="mooring"></a>

AVs could be used to retrieve private boats moored outside the city, relieving the congestion along the canal sides. 

**Questions**
* What is the demand for this service?
* Can AVs park anywhere?
* Is there a central AV depot?
* Where are the mooring locations?
* Does rebalancing AVs improve service levels?

[<< Back to summary](#summary)

### Top-deck swapping<a name="modular"></a>

AVs can go to *outfitting points* (OP) where hulls (the boats' technical basis) are outfitted with different top-decks to service heterogenous commodities (people, freight, garbage, etc.).

**Questions**
* How long does it take to change top decks?
* Where are the OPs where AVs are outfitted?
* Could top decks be crowdsourced?
* What is the capacity and top-deck assortment of each OP?
* How to match top-deck assortment with different demand distributions?

## Edge interface<a name="interface"></a>

A key question for the AV project is how to interface between the canals and streets of Amsterdam. The solutions should be flexible and adaptive for different contexts. We propose three design solutions for different use cases. The first looks to extend the canal edge as a public space with a series of platforms. The second takes a more conventional route with a dynamic platform attached with a stair. The third allows for flexible docking with an extendable ladder.

<img src="http://senseable.mit.edu:60080/uploads/1d32c4697d1943b196337007a2b8bffb.jpg" alt="interface" width="500"/>

***
## Temporary infrastructure<a name="tempinfra"></a>

AV units can join together to create temporary bridges, alleviating congestion on Amsterdam's centuries-old bridges and canal-side streets. As an autonomous system, AV can respond in real-time to the ebb and flow of rush hour traffic.
Individual units can also tessellate to form floating stages and public squares on the canals, enhancing Amsterdam's strong tradition of water-based events with 21st-century technology.
