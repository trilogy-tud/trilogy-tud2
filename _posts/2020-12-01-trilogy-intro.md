TRiLOGy will unlock the potential of transportation and logistics in urban waterways with electric and autonomous vessels by enabling safer, more sustainable and efficient operations.
In order to achieve this goal, there is a need for a joint investigation on fleet management and autonomous sailing.
Fleet management should provide the optimized routes to the autonomy side so that data-driven navigation methods generate a safe and detailed trajectory planning.
The autonomy side should then provide real-time congestion data so that fleet management can use the up-to-date travel times for real-time planning.

TRiLOGy will develop data-driven navigation methods for urban waterways that take into account the complex dynamics of the vessel and the coordination with other traffic participants.
For fleet management, strategic and operational level optimization models will be developed that optimize various decisions such as fleet sizing, fleet mix as well as routing and scheduling of the vessels to meet the demand in an efficient way.

A special challenge lies in the explicit representation of the stochasticity in the demand and network conditions, the adaptive nature with real-time decisions as well as the integration of behavioral models that represent the modal shift towards water.
These methods will be tested with realistic simulations and real-life experiments on different scales of vessels with the involvement of our academic and industrial partners.

TRiLOGy is expected to contribute to an effective use of waterways and liveability of cities with potential benefits in terms of sustainability with the use of electric vessels; in terms of safety with the developed autonomy; and in terms of efficiency with the optimization of transportation and logistics decisions.
Both city logistics, in the form of transportation of construction material, and mobility-on-demand, in the form of water-taxis will be considered for applications.
